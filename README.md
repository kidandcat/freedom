# Freedom

This service uses a "private" mega account as base, and upload files to a second "public" account. If the files get down from the public account, they will be reuploaded.

## TODO
- [ ] Prepare it for cloud functions instead of a loop
- [ ] Support for multiple cross upload public accounts
- [ ] Serve an endpoint to get links
- [ ] Prepare for many private<->public pairs

## Objective

Serve a free service, welcome donations
